# Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 4.0: User Guide

Also available [in PDF format](/cvss/v4-0/cvss-v40-user-guide.pdf).

Document Version: 1.2

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for
communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS
consists of four metric groups: Base, Threat, Environmental, and Supplemental.
The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are
constant over time and across user environments, the Threat group reflects the
characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time, and the Environmental
group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are unique to a
user's environment. Base metric values are combined with default values that
assume the highest severity for Threat and Environmental metrics to produce a
score ranging from 0 to 10. To further refine a resulting severity score, Threat
and Environmental metrics can then be amended based on applicable threat
intelligence and environmental considerations. Supplemental metrics do not
modify the final score, and are used as additional insight into the
characteristics of a vulnerability. A CVSS vector string consists of a
compressed textual representation of the values used to derive the score. This
document provides the official specification for CVSS version 4.0.

The most current CVSS resources can be found at <https://www.first.org/cvss/>

CVSS is owned and managed by FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit
organization, whose mission is to help computer security incident response teams
across the world. FIRST reserves the right to update CVSS and this document
periodically at its sole discretion. While FIRST owns all rights and interest in
CVSS, it licenses it to the public freely for use, subject to the conditions
below. Membership in FIRST is not required to use or implement CVSS. FIRST does,
however, require that any individual or entity using CVSS give proper
attribution, where applicable, that CVSS is owned by FIRST and used by
permission. Further, FIRST requires as a condition of use that any individual or
entity which publishes CVSS data conforms to the guidelines described in this
document and provides both the score and the scoring vector so others can
understand how the score was derived.

# Introduction

This guide supplements the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version
4.0 Specification Document with additional information including significant
changes from CVSS version 3.1, additional scoring guidance, and scoring rubrics.

# Changes in CVSS Version 4.0

Changes between CVSS versions 3.x and 4.0 focus on clarifying and improving the
existing standard.

## CVSS Nomenclature

Numerical CVSS Scores have very different meanings based on the metrics used to
calculate them. Regarding prioritization, the usefulness of a numerical CVSS
score is directly proportional to the CVSS metrics leveraged to generate that
score. Therefore, numerical CVSS scores should be enumerated using nomenclature
that communicates the metrics used in its generation.

| **CVSS Nomenclature** | **CVSS Metrics Used** |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS-B | Base metrics |
| CVSS-BE | Base and Environmental metrics |
| CVSS-BT | Base and Threat metrics |
| CVSS-BTE | Base, Threat, Environmental metrics |

Additional Notes:

* This nomenclature should be used wherever a numerical CVSS value is
  displayed or communicated.
* The application of Environmental and Threat metrics is the responsibility of
  the CVSS consumer. Assessment providers such as product maintainers and
  other public/private entities such as the National Vulnerability Database
  (NVD) typically provide only the Base Scores enumerated as CVSS-B.
* The inclusion of the “E” in the nomenclature is appropriate if any
  Environmental metrics are used to generate the resulting score.
* The inclusion of the “T” in the nomenclature is appropriate if any Threat
  metrics are used to generate the resulting score.
* In CVSS v4.0, Base, Threat, and Environmental metric values are always
  considered in the calculation of the final score. The absence of explicit
  Threat and/or Environmental metric selections will still result in a
  complete score using default (“Not Defined”) values. This nomenclature makes
  it explicit and clear about which metric groups were considered in the
  numerical CVSS score provided.

## CVSS Base Score (CVSS-B) Measures Severity, not Risk

The CVSS Specification Document has been updated to emphasize and clarify the
fact that CVSS Base (CVSS-B) scores are designed to measure the severity of a
vulnerability and should not be used alone to assess risk.

The CVSS v4.0 Specification Document clearly states that the CVSS Base Score
represents only the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability and is
independent of any factor associated with threat or the computing environment
where the vulnerable system resides.

The CVSS Base Score should be supplemented with an analysis of the environment
(Environmental Metrics), and with attributes that may change over time (Threat
Metrics).

For an organization that employs automated methods to comprehensively utilize
the Environmental and Threat metric groups, the resulting CVSS-BTE score can be
considered much closer to “Risk”.

## Changes to Assessment Guidance

The CVSS Specification Document and User Guide have been updated with additional
guidance to help CVSS analysts produce resulting severity scores that are
consistent and defensible across various situations that were previously
considered ambiguous. A sampling of the new assessment guidance is listed below.

### Scope Removed

The concept of Scope has been replaced with the concepts of a vulnerable system
(VC, VI, VA) and a subsequent system (SC, SI, SA), capturing impacts from both,
where relevant. Refer to Section 3.7 for more information.

### Assessing Vulnerabilities in Software Libraries (and Similar)

New guidance explains how to assess the impact of a vulnerability in a library.
Refer to Section 3.9 for more information.

### Multiple CVSS Base (CVSS-B) Scores

Guidance explicitly allows multiple CVSS Base Scores to be generated for a
vulnerability that affects multiple product versions, platforms, and/or
operating systems. Refer to Section 3.10 for more information.

### Guidance for Using Environmental Security Requirements Metrics

The Environmental Metric Group includes three Security Requirement metrics:
Confidentiality Requirement of the vulnerable system (CR), Integrity Requirement
of the vulnerable system (IR), and Availability Requirement of the vulnerable
system (AR). Section 3.14 contains new guidance and examples explaining how
these metrics can be used.

## Guidance for Using Supplemental Metrics

Guidance on assessing each of the new Supplemental Metrics is provided in
Section 4.0.

### New Base Metric: Attack Requirements

In CVSS v3.1, the “low” and “high” Attack Complexity (AC) values do not reflect
the significant differences between conditions currently compressed in the
definition of “high” complexity. For example, the evasion of security mitigation
techniques such as ASLR or crypto objectively require significantly higher
exploit complexity than iterating an attack to win a race condition; yet both
conditions currently result in the same “penalty” to the final severity score.

CVSS v4.0 aims at addressing this by splitting the current AC definition in two
metrics, called “Attack Complexity” (AC) and “Attack Requirements” (AT) that
respectively convey the following:

* Attack Complexity - Reflect the exploit engineering complexity required to
  evade or circumvent defensive or security-enhancing technologies. (defensive
  measures)
* Attack Requirements - Reflect the prerequisite conditions of the vulnerable
  component that make the attack possible.

### Updated Base Metric: User Interaction

The User Interaction Base Metric has been updated to allow for additional
granularity when considering the interaction of a user with a vulnerable
component, and details are as follows:

* **None (N):** The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction
  from any human user, other than the attacker.
* **Passive (P):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires
  limited interaction by the targeted user with the vulnerable component and
  the attacker’s payload. These interactions would be considered involuntary
  and do not require that the user actively subvert protections built into the
  vulnerable component.
* **Active (A):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a
  targeted user to perform specific, conscious interactions with the
  vulnerable component and the attacker’s payload, or the user’s interactions
  would actively subvert protection mechanisms which would lead to
  exploitation of the vulnerability.

### Temporal renamed to the Threat Metric Group

Several changes were made to the Temporal Metric Group:

* Temporal Metric Group renamed to Threat Metric Group
* Remediation Level (usually O) and Report Confidence (usually C) retired
* Exploit Code Maturity renamed Exploit Maturity
* Enhanced impact for Threat Metric values

The Threat Metric Group adjusts the “reasonable worst case” Base score by using
threat intelligence to reduce the CVSS-BTE score, addressing concerns that many
CVSS (Base) scores are too high.

## The CVSS Extensions Framework

Section 3.11 defines a standard method of extending CVSS to include additional
metrics and metric groups while retaining the official Base, Threat, and
Environmental Metrics. The additional metrics allow industry sectors such as
privacy, automotive, etc., to assess factors that are outside the core CVSS
standard.

## New Scoring System Development

The scoring system development for CVSS v4.0 consisted of the following broad
steps. Each step will be described in more detail in the following.

1. Use metric groups to gather the 15 million CVSS-BTE vectors into 270
   equivalence sets
2. Solicit experts to compare vectors representing each equivalence set
3. Use the expert comparison data to calculate an order of vectors from least
   severe to most severe
4. Solicit expert opinion to decide what vector group in the ordering of
   vectors represents the boundary between qualitative severity scores to be
   backwards compatible with qualitative severity score boundaries from CVSS
   v3.x.
5. Compress the vector groups in each qualitative severity bin into the number
   of available scores in that bin (for example, 9.0 to 10.0 for critical, 7.0
   to 8.9 for high, etc.)
6. Create a small score modification factor that adjusts the scores of vectors
   within a vector group so that a change of any metric value results in a
   score change. The intent is that the score change is not larger than the
   uncertainty in the ranking of the vector groups as collected from the expert
   comparison data in step 2.

More details for each of these six steps are as follows:

### Use metric groups to gather the 15 million CVSS-BTE vectors into 270 equivalence sets

This step helps satisfy a couple of design requirements. One is that there are
101 CVSS scores (0.0 to 10.0 by 0.1). The second is that we create the scoring
system using no more time from experts than we have available on a volunteer
basis to the SIG. How this helps meet the first requirement is straightforward –
there has to be some grouping of all the possible vectors because many of them
will have to share a score if there are 15 million options and 101 possible
scores. How this step reduces expert effort into the system is less obvious, and
will be more clear in step 2. The basic idea is that 15 million vectors are too
many for experts to individually rank all of them in any plausibly-achievable
amount of time. This is especially true because any sorting algorithm takes a
number of comparisons proportional to the number of elements to be sorted.
Usually, the work grows in an order faster than the list size (in computational
terms, order nlog(n), see [Sorting algorithm -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)). The impact on
scoring system design is that if we want to get smart input about the whole CVSS
vector space we have to assert some rules about it that help us make structured
use of the data we collect from the expert analysts.

### Solicit experts to compare vectors representing each equivalence set

With the total number of items to compare reduced from 15 million to 270, it was
feasible to ask experts to compare each element to each other element and
totally order the severity of the metric-group-based qualitative sets of
vectors. This is an attractive idea because the SIG could define a score for
every possible BTE vector based on input from every interested SIG member in a
repeatable and private way without sampling from the CVSS vector space. That is,
we could generate a score for each possible vector based on their membership in
the metric-group-based qualitative sets and the relative severity of those sets.

### Use the expert comparison data to calculate an order of vectors from least severe to most severe

The expert comparisons are used as if the metric-group-based vector sets are
competing in a match, and we want to rank the vector sets from "best" to
"worst". The algorithm used to turn these expert comparisons into a ranking is
the same as the algorithm used to take outcomes of chess matches (comparisons)
to rank chess players from best to worst. The name of this algorithm is Elo
([Elo rating system -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)). The output of the
algorithm is a set of "raw" scores called "points". The interpretation of the
point scores for each vector set is that if a vector-set has a score 100 points
higher than another vector-set, then that score difference predicts that an
expert would rate the higher-scored vector set as "more severe" a certain
percentage of the time. In the chess metaphor, would win the match a certain
percentage of the time. The bigger the point-score difference, the larger the
chance the higher-scored vector would be rated as more severe. There are details
of how exactly to configure and run the Elo scoring algorithm that matter;
however, through a SIG-led feedback process, we found the configuration details
tend to converge on a similar set of values. Therefore, we believe the Elo
algorithm output is stable and represents a reliable transformation from the
diverse expert opinion inputs to a single severity ordering of the
metric-group-based vector sets.

### Solicit expert opinion to decide what vector group in the ordering of vectors represents the boundary between qualitative severity scores to be backwards compatible with qualitative severity score boundaries from CVSS v3.x.

Before mapping the 270 metric-group-based vector sets to scores between 0.0 and
10.0, the SIG wanted to improve backwards compatibility with CVSS v3 scores. To
do this, the SIG wanted to decide which metric-group-based vector sets define
the qualitative severity set boundaries. The output of step 3 was a total
ordering of the vector sets. In deciding the qualitative severity boundaries,
the SIG did not change the ordering output by step 3. Rather, the SIG wanted to
decide what CVSS v4 B vector set represented the boundary between critical and
high, high and medium, and medium and low. This was determined by soliciting
input from the 30+ member CVSS SIG. Five (5) members contributed input in the
form of marking the three boundaries in the ordering of vector sets. The SIG's
then defined the boundaries as the average of the 5 SIG members' selections.

### Compress the vector groups in each qualitative severity bin into the number of available scores in that bin (for example, 9.0 to 10.0 for critical, 7.0 to 8.9 for high, etc.)

The second part of maintaining backwards compatibility with CVSS v3 was keeping
the score ranges for each qualitative severity value the same. The result of the
total ordering (step 3) and qualitative severity boundaries (step 4) resulted in
the following number of metric-group-based vector sets in each qualitative
severity value. Note that each vector set has a different number of CVSS v4.0
BTE vectors. However, the SIG does not believe that counting total number of
possible CVSS v4.0 BTE vectors is a relevant way to assess lumpiness of CVSS v4
BTE scores. For example, as of April 2023, there are less than 200,000 total CVE
IDs to date since the inception of the program. Even if 15 million CVSS v4 BTE
scores are possible, many will never be assigned to a CVE ID since there are so
many fewer CVE IDs than vectors. A better assessment of the distribution of CVSS
v4 BTE scores will have to be an empirical assessment of how many times a vector
string actually recurs in actual CVE ID assessments.

Salient to the creation of the scoring system, CVSS v4.0 scoring system was
created as 4 (four) scoring systems created for each qualitative severity score
(critical, high, medium, low), as well as None as a special case for 0.0. Each
qualitative severity score contains a different number of metric-group-based
vector sets and a different number of available scores. The same algorithm is
used for creating a scoring system meeting the requirements for each of
critical, high, medium, and low. That algorithm is agglomerative hierarchical
clustering ([Hierarchical clustering -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering)), which makes
sure that vector sets that share the same CVSS v4 BTE score also have the
smallest difference between their Elo-point scores.

### Create a small score modification factor that adjusts the scores of vectors within a vector group so that a change of any metric value results in a score change. The intent is that the score change is not larger than the uncertainty in the ranking of the vector groups as collected from the expert comparison data in step 2.

The result of step 5 is an option for a CVSS v4.0 scoring system. In order to
meet a requirement that any change in a metric value result in at least a 0.1
change in the CVSS v4 BTE score, the SIG added an additional step to create a
small change in the score based on metric value changes within
metric-group-based vector sets. The vector sets are totally ordered, but of
course especially small differences in vector set Elo-point-scores represent
situations where there were a number of experts who disagreed with the resultant
ordering. Providing a small change based on metric values within vector sets
allows the slightly-more-severe metric strings within a vector set to overlap
the slightly-less-severe metric strings from a nearby but slightly-more-severe
metric-group-based vector set. These small shifts account for the fact that
every vector within an equivalence set is not identical even if they are
importantly and saliently equivalent enough to enable expert opinion ranking to
be possible.

The basic intuition behind these small adjustments is that the CVSS metric
values are ordered within each metric. For example, AV:N is more severe than
AV:A, which is more severe than AV:L, which is more severe than AV:P. There is a
similar ordering for all other metrics. Therefore, it is plausible to
algorithmically define a change in CVSS v4 BTE score based on this ordering.
That is, the expert opinion was used to sort the big-picture ordering of
qualitatively important differences. The small changes in metric value that are
not salient to a metric-group-based equivalence set change can still be used to
represent a small change in the score that is consistent with the Elo-point
difference interpretation of how likely an expert is to rate one vector set as
more severe than another.

## Update to the Version Identifier in the Vector String

The Vector String has been updated so that it begins with CVSS:4.0 rather than
CVSS:3.1. Although no other changes have been made to the Vector String, CVSS
v4.0 contains changes to the definition of some of the metric values and to the
formulas, so it is important to correctly indicate the version of CVSS.

# Assessment Guide

Below are a number of recommendations for consumers when assessing
vulnerabilities with CVSS v4.0.

## Integrate Vulnerability Scan results with Asset Management

It is highly recommended to enrich the results from vulnerability scanning
solutions with asset data. Often, asset management data is kept in a database
that can easily be integrated with vulnerability scan data. Not only will this
step enable a Vulnerability Management team to utilize the Environmental Metric
Group to improve the quality of the resulting CVSS scores, the engineers
responsible for remediating identified vulnerabilities will have more
information at their disposal.

For example, vulnerability scans are conducted against 100 servers. Among other
details, scan results provide the hostname, vulnerability, and the CVSS Base
(CVSS-B) score. The Asset Management database contains records for all servers
where each one contains values for Asset Class, Confidentiality Requirements,
Integrity Requirements, Availability Requirements, and Exposure (Internet or
Internally facing). Once this information is integrated using automation, the
result is a CVSS-BE score that takes those environmental factors into
consideration. Additionally, the Asset Class and similar information can be used
to get the vulnerability to the right engineers for remediation.

## Integrate Vulnerability Scan results with Threat Intelligence

Perhaps one of the most important facets of improving the result of a CVSS
assessment is the application of Threat Data and the use of the Exploit Maturity
(E) metric. Knowing which vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past should
have a significant impact on the resulting score.

There are many sources that can provide threat intelligence regarding the
Exploit Maturity of vulnerabilities. Many of these sources are publicly
available for free and others are offered by commercial organizations for a
subscription cost.

It is important to understand that none of these sources are perfect and it is
highly recommended to gather multiple sources of threat intelligence to improve
the comprehensiveness and fidelity of the information being used to enrich your
vulnerability data.

The application of the threat intelligence should be matched against
vulnerability scan data using automation. The result will be a much more
accurate measurement of the priority that should be applied to those
vulnerabilities being assessed.

## CVSS Scoring in the Exploit Life Cycle

When understanding when to assess the impact of vulnerabilities, analysts should
constrain impacts to a reasonable, final outcome which they are confident an
attacker is able to achieve. For example, consider the following two
vulnerabilities.

In vulnerability 1, a remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a trivial,
crafted request to a web server which causes the web server to disclose the
plaintext password of the root (administrator) account. The analyst only knows
from the vulnerability description that the attacker has access to send a
crafted request to the web server in order to exploit the vulnerability. Impact
should stop there; while an attacker *may* be able to use these credentials to
later execute code as the administrator, it is not known that the attacker has
access to a login prompt or method to execute commands with those credentials.
Gaining access to this password represents a direct, serious loss of
Confidentiality only:

> CVSS-B Score: 8.7
> (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)

In vulnerability 2, a local, low-privileged user can send a trivial, crafted
request to the operating system which causes it to disclose the plaintext
password of the root (administrator) account. The analyst knows from the
vulnerability description that the attacker has access to the operating system,
and can log in as a local, low privileged attacker. Gaining access to this
password represents a direct, serious loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability because the analyst can reasonably issue commands as the root /
administrator account (assume that the attacker could log out from their own
account and log back in as root):

> CVSS-B Score: 8.5
> (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)

## Confidentiality and Integrity, Versus Availability Impacts

The Confidentiality and Integrity metrics refer to impacts that affect the
*data* used by the service. For example, web content that has been maliciously
altered, or system files that have been stolen. The Availability impact metric
refers to the *operation* of the service. That is, the Availability metric
speaks to the performance and operation of the service itself – not the
availability of the data. Consider a vulnerability in an Internet service such
as web, email, or DNS that allows an attacker to modify or delete all web files
in a directory. The only impact is to Integrity, not Availability, as the web
service is still functioning – it just happens to be serving back altered
content.

## Local Vulnerabilities Exploited by Remote Attackers

Guidance concerning Local attacks was improved by clarifying the definitions of
the Network and Adjacent values of the Attack Vector metric. Specifically,
analysts should only assess Network or Adjacent when a vulnerability is bound to
the network stack. Vulnerabilities which require user interaction to download or
receive malicious content (which could also be delivered locally should be
assessed as Local.

For example, a document parsing vulnerability, which does not rely on the
network in order to be exploited, should typically be assessed as Local,
regardless of the method used to distribute such a malicious document (e.g., it
could be a link to a website).

## Vulnerability Chaining

CVSS is designed to classify and rate individual vulnerabilities. However, it is
important to support the needs of the vulnerability analysis community by
accommodating situations where multiple vulnerabilities are exploited in the
course of a single attack to compromise a host or application. The assessment of
multiple vulnerabilities in this manner is termed “vulnerability chaining.” Note
that this is not a formal metric, but is included as guidance for analysts when
assessing these kinds of attacks.

When assessing a chain of vulnerabilities, it is the responsibility of the
analyst to identify which vulnerabilities are combined to form the chained
resulting score. The analyst should list the distinct vulnerabilities and their
resulting score along with the chained resulting score. For example, this may be
communicated within a vulnerability disclosure notice posted on a web page.

In addition, the analyst may include other types of related vulnerabilities that
could be chained with the vulnerabilities being assessed. Specifically, the
analyst may list generic types (or classes) of related vulnerabilities that are
often chained together, or provide further descriptions of required
preconditions that must exist. For example, one might describe how certain kinds
of SQL Injection vulnerabilities are precursors to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack, or how a particular kind of buffer overflow would grant local
privileges. Listing the generic types or classes of vulnerabilities provides the
minimum information necessary to warn other users, without potentially informing
attackers about new exploit opportunities.

Alternatively, the analyst may identify (in the form of a machine readable and
parsable list of vulnerabilities as CVE IDs or CWEs), a complete list of
specific related vulnerabilities that are known to be (or are very likely to be)
chained to one or more of the chained vulnerabilities being assessed in order to
exploit an IT system. In the event that a vulnerability can be exploited only
after other preconditions are met (such as first exploiting another
vulnerability), it is acceptable to combine two or more CVSS scores to describe
the chain of vulnerabilities by assessing the least-restrictive Exploitability
metrics and assessing the most-impactful Impact metrics. The following example
uses the Exploitability and Impact assessment to describe the chain.

Vulnerability **A** is
CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/**VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N**
It requires a local, low-privileged user in order to exploit.

Vulnerability **B** is
**CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P**/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
It provides an unprivileged, remote attacker the ability to execute code on a
system with Low impacts if a local user interacts to complete the attack.

Given A and B, Chain C could be described as the chain of B → A,
**CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P**/**VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N** which
combines the Exploitability of B, and the Impact of A, because if one can
exploit B and gain the code execution as a local user from it, then one has
satisfied the prerequisite to subsequently launch A causing an impact from
vulnerability A.

## Vulnerable System and Subsequent System

The CVSS 4.0 Specification introduces Vulnerable System and Subsequent System
concepts. Let’s look at a few examples to understand how to differentiate
between Vulnerable System impact and Subsequent System impact using examples
borrowed from CVSS 3.1:

1. A vulnerability in a virtual machine that enables an attacker to read and/or
   delete files on the host operating system (perhaps even its own virtual
   machine) demonstrates impact to a Subsequent System (the host operating
   system) as well as to the Vulnerable System (the virtual machine).
2. A violation of a security boundary between microprocessor privilege levels
   should be considered when assessing vulnerabilities using CVSS. User space
   programs’ capabilities running in lower privilege levels are typically
   limited in what instructions they can run and what registers they can write
   to even when running under operating system administrator privileges. A
   vulnerability that allows a program running in a lower privilege level to
   break out and run arbitrary code in a higher privilege level should be
   considered an impact to the Vulnerable System (the microprocessor).
3. The security boundary between secure enclaves integrated in microprocessors
   and the rest of operating system processes, including the operating system
   kernel itself, should be considered when assessing vulnerabilities using
   CVSS. A vulnerability that allows other processes to impact the
   confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or code in a secure
   enclave has impact to the Vulnerable System (the secure enclave where the
   exploit occurs) as well as a Subsequent System (a secure enclave impacted by
   the exploit outside the security boundary of the Vulnerable System) .
4. When a vulnerability in a web application impacts user clients, e.g., web
   browsers, the user clients are Subsequent Systems. Common vulnerabilities of
   this type include cross-site scripting and URL redirection. The
   vulnerability is in the web application, but there is an impact to the
   data/behavior of the victim users’ web browsers.
5. In a distributed environment, a vulnerability in a component providing
   connectivity, protection, or authentication services to components in a
   different security domain should include assessment for the Subsequent
   System(s) if a successful attack impacts these other components. For
   example, a vulnerability in a component such as a router, firewall, or
   authentication manager that affects the primary availability of one or more
   downstream components can impact a Subsequent System. However, if a
   successful attack either does not affect at all, or causes only negligible
   impact to other components, the vulnerability should be assessed as having
   no impact to a Subsequent System. Additionally, a vulnerability in a
   component designed to be deployed as part of a larger fault-tolerant
   topology should not be assessed with a Subsequent System impact if the
   fault-tolerance means a successful attack does not affect other components .
   Any effect on additional services provided by the Vulnerable System is
   considered a secondary impact and not a Subsequent System impact.
6. A vulnerability in a simple Portable Document Format (PDF) reader that
   allows an attacker to compromise other files on the same operating system
   when a victim opens a malicious PDF document is assessed as having no impact
   to a Subsequent System. This assumes the PDF reader does not have any
   authorization functionality that would be considered a separate security
   domain from the underlying operating system.
7. A SQL injection vulnerability in a web application is not usually considered
   as causing impact to a Subsequent System assuming that the credentials are
   shared between web application and impacted SQL database, and therefore they
   are part of the same security scope.
8. A vulnerability that crashes a web server or SSH server is not considered
   impact to a Subsequent System since the impact is limited only to the
   service provided by the affected server. The impact on users is secondary
   and is not considered as impact to a Subsequent System as users are not
   considered constituent elements of the Subsequent System.
9. A vulnerability that permits an attacker to exhaust a shared system
   resource, such as filling up a file system, should not be considered as
   causing impact to a Subsequent System. The attacker is still acting under
   the usual capabilities of the application and not breaching any security
   boundary.
10. By exploiting a vulnerability in an application that allows users restricted
    access to resources shared with other components across multiple security
    scopes (e.g., operating system resources such as system files), an attacker
    can access resources that they should not be able to access. Since there is
    already a valid path across the trust boundary, there is no Subsequent
    System impact.
11. A vulnerability in an application that implements its own security domain
    which allows attackers to affect resources outside its security scope should
    be assessed as having Subsequent System impact. This assumes the application
    provides no features for users to access resources governed by a
    higher-level security domain shared with other components across multiple
    security scopes (e.g., the resources of the underlying operating system).
    One example would be a web application that allows users to read and modify
    web pages and files only under the web application’s installation paths, and
    provides no feature for users to interact beyond these paths. A
    vulnerability in this application allowing a malicious user to access
    operating system files unrelated to this application is considered impact to
    a Subsequent System.

## Vulnerable Systems Protected by a Firewall

If a vulnerability is assessed with an Attack Vector (AV) of Network (N) and the
analyst has high confidence that the vulnerable system is deployed on a secure
network unavailable from the Internet, Modified Attack Vector (MAV) may be
assessed as Adjacent, reducing the resulting severity score.

Example: MySQL Stored SQL Injection (CVE-2013-0375)

> CVSS-B Score: 5.1
> (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N)
>
> CVSS-BE Score: 4.9
> (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/**MAV:A**)

## Assessing Vulnerabilities in Software Libraries (and Similar)

When assessing the impact of a vulnerability in a library, independent of any
adopting program or implementation, the analyst will often be unable to take
into account the ways in which the library might be used. While specific
products using the library should generate CVSS scores specific to how they use
the library, assessing the library itself requires assumptions to be made. The
analyst should account for the reasonable worst-case scenario. When possible,
the CVSS information should detail these assumptions.

For example, a library that performs image conversion would reasonably be used
by programs that accept images from untrusted sources over a network. In the
reasonable worst-case, it would pass them to the library without checking the
validity of the images. As such, an analyst assessing a vulnerability in the
library that relates to the incoming data should assume an Attack Vector (AV) of
Network (N), but explain this assumption in the summary of the vulnerability. If
the library might run with normal privileges, having lower impact on the
embedding implementation, or with high privileges, increasing the impacts, the
analyst should assume high privileges while assessing the vulnerability in the
library.

When assessing a vulnerability in a given implementation using the impacted
library, the metric values must be re-assessed for that specific implementation.
For example, if an implementation embeds the vulnerable system (in this case,
the library mentioned in the previous example), but only operates on local
files, the Attack Vector (AV) would be Local (L). If the implementation that
embeds this library does not invoke any of the faulty functions or does not
support the mode that triggers that vulnerability, it would have no interface or
attack vector to exploit the vulnerability. Thus, that vulnerability in the
embedded library would have no impact on that implementation, resulting in a
severity score for the given implementation of 0.

## Multiple CVSS Base (CVSS-B) Scores

It is common for a vulnerability to be present on multiple product versions,
platforms, and/or operating systems. In some circumstances, the Base metrics may
differ on different product versions, platforms, and/or operating systems. For
example, a hypothetical vulnerability is applicable to multiple operating
systems produced by the same vendor. The Attack Complexity (AC) of this
vulnerability on a legacy operating system is Low (L). However, a newer
operating system has new inherent protection capabilities that change the Attack
Complexity to High (H). This variance ultimately leads to different CVSS-B
scores for the same vulnerability on the two operating systems.

It is acceptable to assess and publish multiple CVSS-B scores for a single
vulnerability provided each has additional language outlining the specific
product versions, platforms, and/or operating systems that are relevant to each
CVSS-B score. Values for all CVSS-B metrics (not only a numeric CVSS-B score)
must be supplied for each affected product version, platform, and/or operating
system using a standard format. In situations where multiple CVSS-B scores are
applicable but only one is provided, the highest CVSS-B score must be utilized.

## CVSS Extensions Framework

Opportunities exist to leverage the core foundation of CVSS for additional
scoring efforts. For example, a proposal was presented to the CVSS Special
Interest Group (SIG) to incorporate privacy into CVSS by overlaying combinations
of CVSS Base and Environmental metrics to derive a Privacy Impact.

The following guidelines define a standard method of extending CVSS to include
additional metrics and metric groups while retaining the official Base, Threat,
and Environmental Metrics. The additional metrics allow industry sectors such as
privacy, safety, automotive, healthcare, etc., to score factors that are outside
the core CVSS standard.

### Guidelines

* Formulas, constants or definitions of existing CVSS Base, Threat, or
  Environmental Metrics must not be modified. If a change to an existing item
  is desired, create a new metric group with a new name and work on it as
  desired.
* New metrics must not be added to existing metric groups, but must be added
  to new metric groups. New metric groups can be based on existing metric
  groups.
* New metric groups can optionally have an impact on the resulting score. If
  they do, the resulting score must be between 0.0 and 10.0, with 10.0 being
  the most severe. The resulting score must be based on adjusting the CVSS-B,
  CVSS-BT, CVSS-BE, CVSS-BTE scores as appropriate.
* The CVSS SIG does not officially approve extensions, but rather acts as a
  consulting body, similar to IETF[1](#fn:1). The CVSS SIG welcomes and encourages
  innovation, but has an interest in maintaining consistency across all
  proposed extensions.
* The list of validated extensions will be listed on the first.org website,
  similar to IANA[2](#fn:2).

  + Mandatory Fields: Name, Description, External Authoritative Web Page
  + Optional Fields: JSON Schema, XML Schema, JavaScript Calculator

### Suggested Vector String Format

CVSS Extension vector strings must be listed separately, utilizing the following
format:

CVSS:4.0/AV:x/AC:x/AT:x/PR:x/UI:x/VC:x/VI:x/VA:x/SC:x/SI:x/SA:x
EXT:1.0/NEW1:VAL1/NEW2:VAL2

where:

EXT:*n*.*n* is a unique extension identifier and major.minor version number

NEW*n* is a unique attribute of the extension for each new metric

VAL*n* is a unique value for the attribute for each new metric value

## Attack Vector Considerations

When scoring Attack Vector, use Adjacent or Network (as appropriate), when a
network connection is required for an attack to succeed, even if the attack is
not launched over a network. For example, a local attacker may be able to trick
a vulnerable, privileged, local program into sending sensitive data to a server
of the attacker’s choosing over a network. As a network connection is required
to gather the sensitive data this is scored with an Attack Vector of Network.

Vulnerabilities where malicious data is received over a network by one system,
then passed to a *separate* system with a vulnerability should be scored with an
Attack Vector of Local. An example is a web browser that downloads a malicious
office document, saves it to disk, and then starts a vulnerable system (in this
case, a document processing application) which reads the saved file.

In cases where the vulnerable system contains the functionality that receives
the malicious data, Attack Vector should be scored as Network. An example is a
web browser with a vulnerability in the browser itself, or a browser plugin or
extension, that triggers when the malicious data is received.

## Non-Repudiation is a Part of Integrity

As per NIST[3](#fn:3) non-repudiation is “Protection against an individual falsely
denying having performed a particular action”. There could be scenarios where a
system user could perform system critical actions, within the user’s own
privilege, and then completely deny performing the action; that would cause a
Repudiation Impact.

Say a system has multiple user admins. One admin gives backdoor access to a
malicious attacker to the system. When the incident is identified, there is no
way to identify the defaulter as there was no logging in place. The malicious
admin didn’t do anything beyond own privileges. But in this case, CWE-778:
Insufficient Logging was the weakness which caused a Repudiation impact, and
hence an Integrity impact. (Example: CVE-2019-8124)

Similarly, in case of horizontal privilege escalation vulnerabilities the
malicious user is usually unable to do something beyond his/her own
capabilities. The delta impact on C, I, and A are None. But the attacker can
still take malicious actions in the system by impersonating another user of the
same privileges leading to a Repudiation impact, and hence an Integrity impact.
(Example: CVE-2017-6785)

Whenever a vulnerability causes a potential repudiation, it immediately impacts
the Integrity of the system, along with other subsequent impacts.

## Security Requirements

This section provides guidance on selecting appropriate metric values for these
based on the characteristics of a specific environment. The examples are
simplified to illustrate the concepts.

### Confidentiality Requirement (CR)

The Confidentiality Requirement of a system should be based on the
classification level of the data that is stored or used by the user and/or
applications running on the target system. Encryption of the data at rest on
this device should also be taken into consideration when establishing the
Confidentiality Requirement. Data that passes through a device without being
consumed or processed (e.g., a switch or firewall) should not be taken into
consideration when assessing this attribute. See below for examples.

Note: The volume of data may influence the value of the attribute, but should
not have as much impact as the classification (i.e., type) of data that is being
stored or used.

1. A device that stores data classified at the highest level should have this
   attribute rated as High. However, if the sensitive data is encrypted at
   rest, this attribute may be rated Medium.
2. A device that stores data classified as non-public but not as high as the
   highest level should have this attribute rated as Medium. However, if the
   sensitive data is encrypted at rest, this attribute can be rated Low.
3. A device that stores data that can be openly shared publicly should have
   this attribute rated as Low.
4. Network equipment such as a router, switch, or firewall will generally be
   rated as Medium due strictly to the sensitivity of information such as
   routing tables, etc.
5. Any system that stores login credentials without encryption should have this
   attribute rated as High. This includes service accounts and credentials
   embedded into scripts or source code.

### Integrity Requirement (IR)

The Integrity Requirements of a system focus on the importance of the accuracy
of the data it stores or uses. Data that passes through a device without being
consumed or processed (e.g., a switch or firewall) should not be taken into
consideration when assessing this attribute. The use of encryption on the data
at rest should *not* be taken into consideration for this attribute. See below
for examples:

1. Devices that contain monetary transactional data and/or personally
   identifiable information (PII) should be rated High.
2. Devices that contain data directly used to make business or risk management
   decisions should be rated at a minimum of Medium. As the severity of the
   decisions increase, so should the Integrity Requirement rating.
3. Devices that contain data directly used to make health decisions should be
   rated High.
4. Network equipment such as a router or switch will generally be rated at
   least Medium due strictly to the sensitivity of information such as
   forwarding tables, etc.
5. Firewalls should be rated as High due to the sensitivity of the rule set.

### Availability Requirement (AR)

The Availability Requirement of a system should be based on the uptime
requirements and redundancy of the device or the applications hosted by the
device. Devices that are part of redundant clusters will have lower Availability
Requirements. See below for examples:

1. Devices without full capacity redundancy that are rated with recovery
   requirements less than 24 hours should be rated High.
2. Devices without full capacity redundancy that are rated with recovery
   requirements between 1-5 days should be rated Medium.
3. Devices with recovery requirements of more than 5 days should be rated Low.
4. Clustered devices and/or those with full capacity redundancy should be rated
   as Low.
5. Devices that are required to have rapid response times for transactional
   purposes based on regulatory requirements, should be rated High.

# Supplemental Metrics

A new, optional metric group called the Supplemental metric group provides new
metrics that describe and measure additional extrinsic attributes of a
vulnerability. The usage of each metric within the Supplemental metric group is
determined by the scoring consumer. This contextual information may be used
differently in each consumer’s environment.

No metric will, within its specification, have any impact on the final
calculated CVSS score (e.g. CVSS-BTE). Organizations may then assign importance
and/or effective impact of each metric, or set/combination of metrics, giving
them more, less, or absolutely no effect on the final risk analysis. Metrics and
values will simply convey additional extrinsic characteristics of the
vulnerability itself.

## Safety

When a system has an intended use or fitness of purpose aligned to safety, it is
possible that exploiting a vulnerability within that system may have Safety
impact which can be represented in the Supplemental Metrics group.

Note that all Supplemental Metrics, including Safety, are completely optional.
Suppliers and vendors may pick and choose whichever Supplemental Metrics they
wish to populate on a case by case basis as they see fit. Lack of a Safety
metric value being supplied does NOT mean that there may not be any
Safety-related impacts.

## Automatable

Some example reasons for why a step in the kill chain may not be reliably
automatable include:

1. the vulnerable system is not searchable or enumerable on the network,
2. weaponization requires human direction for each target,
3. delivery uses channels that widely deployed network security configurations
   block, and
4. exploitation is not reliable, due to exploit-prevention techniques enabled by
   default; ASLR is an example of an exploit-prevention tool. These are example
   reasons, provided for illustration, and are not an exhaustive list of reasons
   why a kill chain step may not be automatable.

As one heuristic for yes, if the vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote
code execution or command injection, the expected response is yes. Analysts
should provide an argument or demonstration that all four steps are able to be
automated rather than solely relying on heuristics.

The definition of automatable is intended to stay materially the same as the
definition of the decision point by the same name in the stakeholder specific
vulnerability categorization (version 2).

## Provider Urgency

Many vendors currently provide supplemental severity ratings to consumers via
product security advisories. Other vendors publish Qualitative Severity Ratings
from the CVSS v3.x Specification Document in their advisories.

To facilitate a standardized method to incorporate additional provider-supplied
assessment, it is proposed to adopt an optional “pass-through” Supplemental
Metric called Provider Urgency.

## Recovery

Recovery describes the resilience of a Component/System to recover services, in
terms of performance and availability, after an attack has been performed.
Values for Recovery include:

* Automatic (A): The Component/System recovers services automatically after an
  attack has been performed.
* User (U): The Component/System requires manual intervention by the user to
  recover services, after an attack has been performed
* Irrecoverable (I): The Component/System services are irrecoverable by the
  user, after an attack has been performed.

## Value Density

The following are suggestive examples of when to select the Diffuse or
Concentrated metric values for this metric.

Diffuse: Examples of systems with diffuse value are email accounts, most
consumer online banking accounts, common cell phones, and most personal
computing resources owned and maintained by users. (A “user” is anyone whose
professional task is something other than the maintenance of the system or
component. A “system operator” is anyone who is professionally responsible for
the proper operation or maintenance of a system.)

Concentrated: Heuristically, such systems are often the direct responsibility of
“system operators” rather than users. (A “user” is anyone whose professional
task is something other than the maintenance of the system or component. A
“system operator” is anyone who is professionally responsible for the proper
operation or maintenance of a system.) Examples of concentrated value are
database systems, Kerberos servers, web servers hosting login pages, and cloud
service providers. However, usefulness and uniqueness of the resources on the
vulnerable system also inform value density. For example, encrypted mobile
messaging platforms may have concentrated value, not because each phone’s
messaging history has a particularly large amount of data, but because it is
uniquely valuable to law enforcement.

The definition of value density is intended to stay materially the same as the
definition of the decision point by the same name in the stakeholder specific
vulnerability categorization (version 2).

## Vulnerability Response Effort

The intention of the Vulnerability Response Effort metric is to provide
supplemental information on how difficult it is for consumers to provide an
initial response to the impact of vulnerabilities for deployed products and
services in their infrastructure. The consumer can then take this additional
information on effort required into consideration when applying mitigations
and/or scheduling remediation.

When calculating Vulnerability Response Effort, the effort required to deploy
the quickest available response should be considered.

# Glossary of Terms

As much as possible, we will use standard definitions for terms and prefer
global, consensus, freely available definitions.[4](#fn:4)

**Affected**: A system is affected by a vulnerability if a user or operator of
the system must take action to remediate, mitigate, or otherwise address the
vulnerability.[5](#fn:5) If a system is affected by a vulnerability, the CVSS v4.0
Base score must not be 0.0.

**Attacker**: A human person that “...attempts to evade security services and
violate the security policy of a system. That is, an actual assault on system
security….”[6](#fn:6), often but not always attempted by exploiting a vulnerability in
the system. (Consistent with NIST [CSRC
definitions](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/attacker), an attacker is a
person.)

**Chained score**: The Base Score produced by scoring two or more chained
vulnerabilities.

**Chained vulnerabilities**: See *Vulnerability Chaining*.

**Compensating Controls**: The security and privacy controls implemented in
lieu of the controls in the baselines described in NIST Special Publication
800-53 that provide equivalent or comparable protection for a system or organization.

**Consumer**: The security team that manages the environment in which the
vulnerable product is deployed.

**Default credential**: Data such as a user name and password that is initially
configured and allows authentication unless it has been changed. A default
credential may be shared by many systems or unique to individual systems. A
system may force a default credential to be changed.

**Environment**: A physical or logical deployment of interrelated systems. A
cloud (of which there could be multiple), on prem (a single or group of data centers),
or a logically distinct environment like a DMZ or Development (as opposed to production).

**Hard-coded credential**: Data such as a user name and password that is always
configured, always allows authentication, and cannot be changed or disabled.

**Mitigation (Control)**: A decision, action, or practice intended to reduce the
level of risk associated with one or more threat events, threat scenarios,
or vulnerabilities.

**Privilege**: A collection of rights (typically read, write, and execute)
granted to a user or user process which defines access to computing resources.
The terms “privilege,” “permission,” and “authorization” are used
interchangeably.[7](#fn:7)

**Proof-of-Concept exploit code:** Software or sufficient technical details that
can be used to demonstrate the existence of a vulnerability.

**Published**: Any publicly, commercially, or socially available exploit code.

**Reasonable worst-case**: An instance of a plausible path to the exploitation
of a vulnerability, the worst-case after any unreasonable high-impact
low-likelihood paths have been discountedIt is not a prediction of what will
happen, rather an illustration of what could reasonably be foreseen by an
experienced analyst and that would require response action by a security
professional or team.[8](#fn:8)

**Reported**: Based on applicable threat intelligence, activity targeting the
vulnerability is known by someone other than the attacker and the victim.

**Resource**: Asset used or consumed during the execution of a
process[.](https://www.iso.org/standard/63711.html)[9](#fn:9) Examples of resources
include (but are not limited to) file contents, file identifiers, memory
pointers, memory contents, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth.

**Security domain**: Set of assets and resources subject to a common security
policy.[10](#fn:10)

**Security policy:** A set of policy rules (or principles) that direct how a
system (or an organization) provides security services to protect sensitive and
critical system resources.[11](#fn:11)

**Solutions to simplify**: Software that makes exploitation of the vulnerability
trivial, including exploit frameworks, such as Metasploit or Cobalt Strike, or
other tools that work reliably and against many different systems.

**System, information system:** An organized assembly of computing and
communication resources and procedures — i.e., equipment and services, together
with their supporting infrastructure, facilities, and personnel — that create,
collect, record, process, store, transport, retrieve, display, disseminate,
control, or dispose of information to accomplish a specified set of
functions.[12](#fn:12) Uses of “system” means “Information system” unless otherwise
specified. Information systems include, for example, IT systems, ICS systems, OT
systems, computing hardware, and so on.

**Subsequent System**: A system whose security policy is violated as a result of
the exploited vulnerability but that is not the Vulnerable System.

**Successful attack**: A successful attack (or successful exploit of a
vulnerability) is a situation where an attacker violates the security policy of
an information system.

**Supply Chain**: A subset of industry members (often cutting across many industries)
that contribute to the production of goods and services that an organization
(industry, or geopolitical entity) consumes.

**Threat Intelligence**: Additional information from information sharing groups
such as the ISAC’s (Information Sharing and Analysis Center), CISA KEV or private
sources of cyber intelligence.

**User**: An authorized human person. For CVSS, usually said of a person
authorized to access a vulnerable system affected by the vulnerability being
scored.

**Vendor**: The producers and maintainers of information systems.

**Vulnerability**: A weakness or flaw in the functional behavior of an
information system (software or hardware) that can be exploited, resulting in a
negative impact to the Confidentiality, Integrity, and/or Availability of the
vulnerable system or a subsequent system (that is, the violation of a security
policy of an information system).[13](#fn:13)

**Vulnerability chaining**: The sequential exploitation of multiple
vulnerabilities in order to attack an information system, where one or more
exploits at the end of the chain requires the successful completion of prior
exploits in order to be exploited.[14](#fn:14)

**Vulnerable System**: A system whose security policy is violated as the result
of an exploited vulnerability and which contains the vulnerability.
